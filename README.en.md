## What does a backend developer do, and how is it different from frontend?
A backend developer works on the parts of a software or web application that users donâ€™t see. That includes the logic behind the scenes, data management, user sessions, security, APIs, and database operations.

While frontend developers build the interface users interact with, backend developers make sure that this interface works properly by handling the data and logic it needs.

For example, when a user submits a form, itâ€™s the backend system that processes that data â€” validating, storing, and sometimes analyzing it.

I personally chose the backend path because I enjoy working with logic and data. Solving complex problems and building the foundation of a system feels more meaningful and exciting to me.

## What is a REST API and what is it used for?
A REST API is a structure that allows different systems to communicate with each other. It's especially used so the frontend and backend can exchange data.

REST stands for "Representational State Transfer" and works over the HTTP protocol. An API is like a communication gateway that lets an application talk to the outside world.

For example, when a user wants to view a list of products through the app interface, the frontend sends this request to the backend via a REST API. The backend receives the request, processes it, fetches the data from the database, and sends it back to the frontend.

Thanks to REST APIs, systems can work independently from each other. This makes the software easier to scale and manage.

## What are HTTP methods? What are they used for? (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
HTTP methods allow a client (usually the frontend) to tell the server (backend) what action it wants to perform.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the four most commonly used HTTP methods:

GET: Used to retrieve data from the server. For example, when we want to view a list of products, the frontend sends a GET request to the backend.

POST: Used to send and save new data to the server. For instance, submitting a registration form is done via a POST request.

PUT: Used to completely update existing data. For example, updating a user's profile information is done using PUT.

DELETE: Used to delete specific data from the server. For example, deleting a user account.

These methods help ensure clear and organized communication between the frontend and backend. In REST APIs, we use these methods to perform different operations in a standardized way.
