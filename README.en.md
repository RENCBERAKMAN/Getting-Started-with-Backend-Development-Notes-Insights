## What does a backend developer do, and how is it different from frontend?
A backend developer works on the parts of a software or web application that users don’t see. That includes the logic behind the scenes, data management, user sessions, security, APIs, and database operations.

While frontend developers build the interface users interact with, backend developers make sure that this interface works properly by handling the data and logic it needs.

For example, when a user submits a form, it’s the backend system that processes that data — validating, storing, and sometimes analyzing it.

I personally chose the backend path because I enjoy working with logic and data. Solving complex problems and building the foundation of a system feels more meaningful and exciting to me.
